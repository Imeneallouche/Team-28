title: "Find the Hardcoded Flag!"
author: "Medabis Amina"
category: "Reverse Engineering"
difficulty: "Easy (for beginners)"
description: 
  In this challenge, a hardcoded flag is embedded in an .exe file as a sequence of hexadecimal values.
  Your task is to reverse engineer the .exe file, convert the hexadecimal values to their corresponding ASCII characters, and retrieve the flag.
  
  The flag is stored in the program as an array of hexadecimal bytes, which can be decoded into ASCII characters.
  Once you've figured out the flag, input it into the program to verify whether your answer is correct or not.

  Good luck!

hints:
  - "Use a disassembler to analyze the binary and locate the flag (e.g., Ghidra)."
  - "The flag is stored as a sequence of hexadecimal values. Convert them to ASCII."
  - "The flag contains 23 characters."
